    <string name="question_1">Food is a hot commodity! If we produce food that doesn\’t get eaten, what else is wasted?</string>

    <string name="wrong_answer_tip">It\'s actually 30%. About a third of the food produced on the planet goes to waste.
        Waste happens in every link of our food supply chain—from the fruit that never makes it off the farm to the vegetables you forgot were in your fridge.
        TIP: There are lots of things we can do to shop, cook, and eat smarter!</string>
